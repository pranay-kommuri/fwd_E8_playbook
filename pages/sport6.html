            <p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each. The game is played on a diamond-shaped field with four bases arranged in a square. One team bats while the other fields, with the goal of the batting team being to score runs by hitting the pitched ball and running around the bases. A run is scored when a player successfully reaches home plate after touching each base in sequence. The fielding team aims to get batters out through various methods such as striking them out, catching the ball, or tagging players. Baseball is widely popular in the U.S., Japan, and many Latin American countries.</p>

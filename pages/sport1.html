            <p>Football, known as soccer in some countries, is the worldâ€™s most popular sport, played and watched by billions. It is a team sport where two teams of 11 players each compete to score goals by getting a ball into the opposing team's net. The game is played on a rectangular field, and players primarily use their feet to control and pass the ball, although other parts of the body, except the hands and arms, can also be used. Football is celebrated for its simplicity, yet requires skill, strategy, and teamwork. It brings people together, transcending cultural and linguistic barriers worldwide.</p>

            <p>Handball is a fast-paced team sport played on a rectangular court, where two teams of seven players each attempt to score goals by throwing a ball into the opposing team's net. The game is played with a ball that can be passed, dribbled, and shot with the hands. Players can use their bodies to block shots and defend their goal, but they cannot touch the ball with their feet. Handball is known for its high-scoring nature, requiring agility, speed, and teamwork. It is particularly popular in Europe, with major competitions like the IHF World Championship and the Olympic Games drawing large audiences.</p>

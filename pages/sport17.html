            <p>Karate is a traditional martial art that originated in Japan and focuses on striking techniques using the hands, feet, elbows, and knees. It emphasizes discipline, respect, and self-control, with practitioners training in various forms (known as "katas"), sparring, and self-defense techniques. Karate is known for its powerful, precise strikes, and its use of both offensive and defensive moves. Training involves a progression of colored belts, with the ultimate goal of achieving mastery and the highest ranks, such as black belt. It has become a popular sport worldwide, practiced for fitness, self-defense, and competition, including in the Olympic Games.</p>

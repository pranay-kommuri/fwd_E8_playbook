            <p>Athletics is a group of competitive sports that involve physical contests, primarily running, jumping, throwing, and walking. It is one of the oldest forms of sports, with events dating back to ancient civilizations. The most common athletics events include sprints, middle-distance, and long-distance running, as well as hurdles, high jump, long jump, pole vault, shot put, discus throw, javelin throw, and decathlon (a multi-event competition). Athletics is known for its emphasis on individual performance, although there are also team-based events, such as relay races. It is a core component of the Summer Olympic Games and is widely practiced at various levels worldwide.</p>
